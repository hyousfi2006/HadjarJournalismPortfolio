This website is an online portfolio compiling some of my strongest journalism work, created for a journalism competition that required a public, accessible digital submission.

The site showcases a selection of my reporting, writing, and storytelling across different formats, highlighting my ability to research topics thoroughly, communicate clearly, and present information in an engaging and organized way. Each piece reflects my approach to journalism: accuracy, clarity, and thoughtful narrative.

The portfolio is designed to be simple and easy to navigate so that readers, judges, and reviewers can focus on the work itself. It serves both as a competition submission and as a personal archive of my journalism experience and growth.

This project was created entirely using HTML and CSS.
